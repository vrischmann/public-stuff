### Batch.com

2023/02 - Present

#### Staff engineer

<div>

Batch.com is a marketing automation platform serving billions of requests and push notifications per day.

After more than 9 years as a software engineer and senior software engineer at Batch, I got promoted to staff engineer.

My role is now focused on helping the different product squads achieve their goals, improve the engineering processes of the company in collaboration with the CTO and overall being a "multiplying factor".

I am now responsible in the _platform_ squad, helping improve the services, frameworks and libraries used by every team in the company. I also help with system designs, either by participating or reviewing.

Finally, I am lead of the backend _guild_; I help keep our backend stacks up to date, reduce frustration and improve quality of life for the guild members. Twice per month we organize a _guild day_ where
all guild members are gathered together to work on projects that will improve our stacks.
