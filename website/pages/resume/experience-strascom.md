### Strascom

2010/02 - 2013/02

#### Software engineer

<div>

Strascom was building an advertising network serving banners and popups on publishers' websites.

My missions were to maintain the existing C++ codebase, build new services using Java and PostgreSQL and deploy them.

I was also responsible for provisioning, deploying and managing a fleet of bare-metal servers.

I also took the opportunity to bring new processes, such as setting up a VCS and adding unit tests.
