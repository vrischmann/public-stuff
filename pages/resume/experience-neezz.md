#### Software engineer

<div>

neezz.com was an email service startup. I was tasked with developing and deploying a platform to send emails.

My main mission was developing the backend services to schedule, create, personalise and send emails; I used Java, MySQL, Redis to do this.

My second mission was deploying and managing a fleet of servers were the services were deployed; this involved provisioning bare-metal servers and managing configuration using Puppet.
